Thank you for downloading Luno.  
Luno is a Roblox™ executor that lets you execute Lua™ Programming Language scripts.

This software requires an active internet connection to function properly.  
Luno connects to servers to install, fix, or add necessary files.

When first downloading Luno, you will receive "Luno Bootstrapper.exe".  
Keep this executable in a folder (preferably the one it came with), as it will install Luno’s files directly into that folder.

Run the bootstrapper executable to install Luno.  
If files are removed or corrupted, the bootstrapper may reinstall missing or damaged files.  
If Luno requires an update, it will automatically launch the bootstrapper which will complete the update process.

Below you can view the VirusTotal scan. This confirms that Luno is not malicious and is safe.  
These scans have been made without the API in place and only showcase the legitimacy of the Luno app itself.
