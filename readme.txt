Thank you for downloading Luno.
Luno is a Roblox™ executor that lets you execute Lua™ Programming Language scripts.

This software requires an active internet connection to function properly. Luno connects with servers to install, fix, or add files.

When first downloading Luno, you will be given "Luno Bootstrapper.exe". Keep this executable in a folder (preferably the one that it came with) because it will install Luno's files directly in the folder this Bootstrapper is located in.

Run the Bootstrapper executable to install Luno. If files are removed or corrupted, the Bootstrapper may reinstall missing or damaged files. If Luno requires an update, Luno will run the Bootstrapper and then close itself so it can update files.

Below you can view VirusTotal scan. This is to confirm that Luno is not malicious and is safe. These scans have been made without the API in place and only showcase the legitimacy of the Luno app itself.
